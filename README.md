# Prosjekt-repo for TDT4100

This repo contains the .java and .fxml files for the project in TDT4100 - Object-Oriented programming.

The project is a tile-based puzzle game, where the player needs to get from one place to another. In order to do so, the player can move freely around the level. The player needs to use their surroundings and objects in the level to reach the goal.
