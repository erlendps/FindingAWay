# Finding a Way

This is a tile-based puzzle game, where the player needs to get from one place to another. In order to do so, the player can move freely around the level. The player needs to use their surroundings and objects in the level to reach the goal. It also has an level-editor, so that the user can use their own imagination to create a custom level.
